24,1924,"The film version of Robert W. Service's ""The Roughneck,"" now on view at the Central Theatre, is a boy's idea of adventure with plenty of scenes of George O'Brien's biceps and ankles. After observing all that Mr. O'Brien experiences as Jerry Delaney, one concludes that he needs his deep chest and brawny arms. Mr. O'Brien goes to no particular pains to conceal that he has the strength of an ox and the ankles of a Mercury. He has an artistic waist line, a physiognomy suited to adventurous rôles in melodramatic pictures and dark hair with the suggestion of a curl.Delaney is a judicious modern knight. In one sequence the pretty heroine. Felicity Arden (Billie Dove), is forced by a storm to take refuge in Mad Marrat's dwelling on the South Sea Isle. Jerry's mother is well aware of Marrat's designing brutality, and she therefore urges her son to hasten over to the other section of the island and save the girl, with whom he is in love. He is about to start, when he thinks it over, saying to his mother: ""I can't go. I have got one man's death to answer for.""Jerry began to have adventures as a small boy, and he has them thrust upon him until the closing scene of this picture. No sooner has he escaped from drowning that he is asked to engage in a fist fight, which is delayed for monetary reasons until that evening.The fight appears to be going against the hero—as these conflicts usually do on the screen—when suddenly Jerry's opponent blurts out an insult about Jerry's mother, and he flares up and punches with such vim and rapidity that when they look at the other man he is thought to be dead.One of Jerry's passing adventures takes place when he is aboard a vessel bound from San Francisco for Tahiti. Felicity is on the steamship, and, as Jerry has been a stowaway, the girl urges him to swim ashore. It is a full five miles, which would not have been such a terrible task for this young gentleman, but Felicity had not calculated upon sharks. As soon as they are mentioned in a subtitle, one of these man-eaters appears, its dorsal fin being seen hurrying in Jerry's direction, acting more like a motor launch than one's conception of a shark. Here one has to be very young and quite credulous, for a native girl springs from her craft and goes to Jerry's rescue, engaging the fish in battle under water. One sees Jerry having his tussle under the surface, and then the lithe form of the girl putting a knife through the shark's belly.This picture is made up of this type of thrills, which are hardly convincing to an adult. The most capable actor in the cast is Harry T. Morey, who has the rôle of Marrat, the villain. He is well worth seeing. Miss Dove is attractice as Felicity and Cleo Madison is competent in the maternal rôle. Mr. O'Brien apepars to have a weakness for displaying his figure, but otherwise his performance is good.This is an extravagant story which is only likely to apepal to the youthful mind.

52,1924,"With its constantly changing scene of wondrous beauty and players in medieval costumes who appear to belong to the life of yesteryear, the picturization of George Eliot's ""Romola,"" was presented last night before a brilliant gathering in the George M. Cohan Theatre. It mattered not that the narrative was unfolded with deliberation or that the villain held the stage more than the heroine or the hero, as the shadows were always stirring with their remarkable scenic effects, the artistic lighting and the obvious endeavor to have every little detail put forth with a careful reflection of past ages.This entrancing shadow story was produced in Italy, Florence being used as the background for the romance of Romola, the faithful and loving daughter of Bardo Bardi, the blind scholar, whose books singularly enough compensated him for the loss of his eyesight. Last night one saw him before his great hearth, Romola kneeling beside him and Carlo Bucellini (Ronald Colman) ever ready to do the bidding of the old man or the wistful maid.Lillian Gish plays the part of Romola, and her sister Dorothy is cast as Tessa, the humble daughter of a marketing woman. William H. Powell, who gained no little fame by a part he played in ""The Bright Shawl,"" figures as Tito Melema. He gives a splendid performance.Henry King, the director of ""The White Sister,"" was the guiding spirit of this new production. He has a style of his own, and his artistic bent is apparent in most of the glorious scenes of this film. The settings are really something to marvel at, and no less impressive are the exteriors. There are white, winding roadways flanked by sun-bleached stone walls, old gates that have stood the test of centuries of seasons, worm-eaten oaken doors, cobble-stone squares and a glimpse of a lazily flowing river. Mr. King used Florence for all it was worth in this picture, and even if the story were not as good as it is, the scenes are so beautiful that they in themselves are worth every instant one spends viewing this picture. At times the photography is of such excellence that it appears to have depth. There are views in the sunshine and others tinted for moonlight which would awaken enthusiasm in the eyes of any artist.Added to all this there is the presence of the graceful, restrained, thoughtful and spiritual Lillian Gish, who never appears to make a false move or a wrong expression during the many scenes in which she appears. Her sister Dorothy is of a different temperament, but she suits the part she fills in this film. She is boisterous, impulsive, credulous, but passionately devoted to Tito, the scoundrel who deceives the two girls and his father.In the opening scenes there are the ships with their men of brawn pulling with sharp, quick strokes on the great oars—the galley slaves. Tito is returning from Greece with his foster father when their vessel is attacked by pirates. The father urges Tito to leap into the water and swim ashore, so that the young man can sell the jewels and eventually rescue the old man. He has courage to plow his way through the calm water to safety, but Tito's eyes are ever ready to flash with affection upon a pretty Florentine maid. He, therefore, forgets about his old father, and pulls strings to get into politics.His sauve sympathy appeals to old Bardi, who in the end suggests that Tito wed his daughter. You see Bardi on his favorite chair, before the blazing fire with its cone-shaped chimney, inhaling a perfume from a flower he holds between his thumb and forefinger. Suddenly Romola lets fall a book and the irate father springs to his feet, quickly reminding the girl that the books mean everything to him. Tito promises that he will carry on the work of the old man, but, as usual, he finds it convenient to do otherwise. In the end he sells the precious books.There is a fine dramatic sequence where Romolo has been injured by the maddened mob and is taken to Tessa's stone dwelling. Tessa expects her husband, who is now clad as Carpaccio pictured the Venetian dandies—with doublet and hose, and slashed sleeves filled with blossoming varicolored silks. Romola does not know that the man who is the father of Tessa's baby, is also her own husband.Another thrilling chapter is where Baldassarre Calvo, Tito's foster father, reaches Florence as a weary, footsore tramp. Tito impudently denies that he knows the aged man, but finally when Baldassarre is brought into the banquet hall by Carlo, Tito asserts that the old man was a servant who imagined that he had been cheated out of his rightful possessions. The old man is livid with rage, and forthwith staggers to a shop where he purchases a knife with which to stab Tito. In the end, however, Baldassarre discovers Tito exhausted after escaping from the Florentines by plunging into the river. You see the hate in the eyes of the white-haired man as he takes Tito's head and holds it under the water to die.There are many heads in close-ups put forth on the screen that resemble paintings by old masters. The gowns worn by Lillian Gish make her look like some wistful beauty of the fifteenth century who had come to life through modern shadows.In some sequences this picture could be improved by a better assembling of the scenes, as at times one believes days have passed, when it finally transpires that it is only half an hour. The cutter has also permitted himself too much liberty in disposing of the action of one scene and shifting to another. We imagine that this will be remedied. This is a film to be remembered, and the gorgeous scenes will never be forgotten. THE SCREEN; A Florentine Story."

59,1924,"The struggle of Germany's poor for food in 1923 is the theme of David Wark Griffith's remarkable new film offering. ""Isn't Life Wonderful?"" which is the principal attraction at the Rivoli this week. It was translated to the screen from a story written by Major Geoffrey C. G. Moss, formerly a brother officer of the Prince of Wales in the Grenadier Guards. Major Moss has said that incidents arising from the occupation of the Ruhr Valley made him bitterly antagonistic to the French.Mr. Griffith, however, disregards the inspiration for this literary effort and contents himself with a fling at the Kaiser and those responsible for war, without any reference to France. Through countless deft and effective touches in this simple yet deeply stirring narrative Mr. Griffith again proves himself a brilliant director. He depicts the listlessness and dulled eyes in individuals resulting from an ill-nourished condition, the apathy to meals consisting of little more than horse turnips, morning, noon and night: the disappointment in the scramble for a bit of meat, the exhilaration of a family over the hardly believable sight of a bowl of steaming potatoes, the arousing of exuberant spirits in half a dozen persons through the possession of a single egg and the boundless joy caused by a feast with liverwurst.The exteriors of this photoplay were made in Copenick, near Berlin, which is the actual background of the author's story. The interiors were produced in Mr. Griffith's Mamaroneck studio. The principal players, Carol Dempster and Neil Hamilton, are ably supported by others in the cast.The love story of Inga (Miss Dempster) and Hans (Mr. Hamilton) is unfolded with charming simplicity, there being only a few instances in which Mr. Griffith's direction is theatric. He propounds the idea that although scenic beauty loses its attraction to famished persons, love is paramount. Inga and Hans diffidently inform the family that they wish to get married, which elicits the apathetic inquiry: ""On what—turnips?""Theodore, a student son, works in a night club, where, to prevent the stealing of food the waiters are searched as they leave. One is delighted when two Americans buy all the liverwurst in the night club for Theodore. One billion marks worth of liverwurst! It wasn't a very big piece after all, but when Theodore encounters Hans and Inga, who have dug up plenty of potatoes on their allotment, the three dance arm in arm through the middle of the narrow road, their faces lighted up with delirious joy. This scene will surely bring applause every time it is shown.On the same day as Theodore received his magnificent gift; one of the two hens lays an egg. Inga holds the precious egg in her two hands as she shows it to the grandmother.Inga supplements her daily toil by working at night mending cane seated chairs in an antique shop, being paid in secondhand furniture. She deprives herself of her quota of potatoes so as to give food to Hans when he is ill, and to impress him as being well nourished, she pads her cheeks with paper.In a moment of affluence the sons send Inga to buy three pounds of meat. A long line is seen outside the butcher's shop, the door of which is guarded by armed soldiers. An hour passes, two hours, three hours, and still Inga has not gained the threshold of the shop. Meanwhile the price of meat has nearly doubled, which she learns as she watches the man continually changing the chalk figures on a slate. In the end she has insufficient money to buy enough meat, so invests it in bread. Another scene shows a line waiting outside a horsemeat shop, and dejection darkens the faces of men and women when they are told there is no more.Poverty stamps, its mark even in the pathetic cabaret show, in which the dancers wear paper costumes which rip and tear when slightly strained. Toward the end of this picture Hans and Inga are seen as the victims of lazy marauders who steal all their cartload of potatoes. Hans is beaten until he is unconscious, but when he opens his eyes and learns from Inga that all the potatoes are gone, he looks at her and as he kisses her says: ""Isn't life wonderful?""Erville Alderson impersonates an absentminded professor. He gives a splendid performance in which delicate comedy touches are most appealing. Lupino Lane plays the part of one of the boys, and he also cheers up the story, which after all is so well told that it is rarely depressing. Miss Dempster is excellent in her exacting rôle. She looks delicate, wistful and natural without any exaggerated make-up. Mr. Hamilton is capable as Hans, but he hardly impresses one as being in want of food. Helen Lowell does very well as the grandmother.Possibly this story would be even stronger if the sequence with which it is ended were put back and replaced by the dinner chapter, which would make a powerful climax.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld introduces this picture with a beautiful prologue with twinkling sapphire stars embedded in a midnight-blue background, enhanced by the colorful costumes of the singers.Max Fleischer's cartoon, ""The Cure,"" is unusually clever.

662,1924,"The film version of Robert W. Service's ""The Roughneck,"" now on view at the Central Theatre, is a boy's idea of adventure with plenty of scenes of George O'Brien's biceps and ankles. After observing all that Mr. O'Brien experiences as Jerry Delaney, one concludes that he needs his deep chest and brawny arms. Mr. O'Brien goes to no particular pains to conceal that he has the strength of an ox and the ankles of a Mercury. He has an artistic waist line, a physiognomy suited to adventurous rôles in melodramatic pictures and dark hair with the suggestion of a curl.Delaney is a judicious modern knight. In one sequence the pretty heroine. Felicity Arden (Billie Dove), is forced by a storm to take refuge in Mad Marrat's dwelling on the South Sea Isle. Jerry's mother is well aware of Marrat's designing brutality, and she therefore urges her son to hasten over to the other section of the island and save the girl, with whom he is in love. He is about to start, when he thinks it over, saying to his mother: ""I can't go. I have got one man's death to answer for.""Jerry began to have adventures as a small boy, and he has them thrust upon him until the closing scene of this picture. No sooner has he escaped from drowning that he is asked to engage in a fist fight, which is delayed for monetary reasons until that evening.The fight appears to be going against the hero—as these conflicts usually do on the screen—when suddenly Jerry's opponent blurts out an insult about Jerry's mother, and he flares up and punches with such vim and rapidity that when they look at the other man he is thought to be dead.One of Jerry's passing adventures takes place when he is aboard a vessel bound from San Francisco for Tahiti. Felicity is on the steamship, and, as Jerry has been a stowaway, the girl urges him to swim ashore. It is a full five miles, which would not have been such a terrible task for this young gentleman, but Felicity had not calculated upon sharks. As soon as they are mentioned in a subtitle, one of these man-eaters appears, its dorsal fin being seen hurrying in Jerry's direction, acting more like a motor launch than one's conception of a shark. Here one has to be very young and quite credulous, for a native girl springs from her craft and goes to Jerry's rescue, engaging the fish in battle under water. One sees Jerry having his tussle under the surface, and then the lithe form of the girl putting a knife through the shark's belly.This picture is made up of this type of thrills, which are hardly convincing to an adult. The most capable actor in the cast is Harry T. Morey, who has the rôle of Marrat, the villain. He is well worth seeing. Miss Dove is attractice as Felicity and Cleo Madison is competent in the maternal rôle. Mr. O'Brien apepars to have a weakness for displaying his figure, but otherwise his performance is good.This is an extravagant story which is only likely to apepal to the youthful mind. THE SCREEN; Strained Adventures."

2237,1924,"The story of ""Circe the Enchantress,"" the new film presentation at the Capitol this week, was written specially for Mae Murray by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, author of ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse."" The author gives the irrepressible screen star plenty of opportunity to satisfy her usual desire for long stretches of syncopated action, which are a decided contrast to the later chapters of the narrative.Ibáñez is said to have witnessed more than one of Miss Murray's pictures, and it apparently occurred to him that the most dramatic situation that could happen to such a nimble-footed dancer would be to have her temporarily deprived of the use of her legs through an automobile accident. Hence in the last chapter of this fantastic story one sees the dazzling Cecile Brunne (Miss Murray) limp haltingly into the arms of the hero. Thereafter one perceives Cecile unusually quiet, which, of course, is strange when one thinks of Miss Murray.For the most part of this picture, however, Miss Murray has things her own way, as in this exquisitely staged production Cecile is introduced as a dazzling vision in white, bejeweled from forehead to ankle. In her ecstatic delight she cares little about her shimmering gowns, as in one of the giddy sequences in which she is the only woman in a Long Island mansion she makes fools of the men who are captivated by her beauty by plunging into an artificial lake and insisting that they follow her. These puppets, as she calls them, attired in dress suits, obey the fascinating flirt by splashing awkwardly through the water.Miss Murray gives an exhibition of dancing, while a negro jazz orchestra delights in the blare and quick movements of the graceful dancer. Miss Murray's lips are made up in a futuristic shape and her eyebrows are diagonal. Altogether, she is exotic, graceful, dainty and lithe.James Kirkwood impersonates Dr. Van Martyn, the hero. He is a guest at one of the wild parties, but soon tires of the company and the dizzy amusement, leaving without thanking his hostess. Cecile is patterned after Circe, the goddess who beguiled Ulysses and his warriors. The young Long Island hostess finds that the quiet Dr. Van Martyn has caused her heart to throb, and in her desire to forget him she becomes more reckless than ever. You see her throwing dice, first for $1,000 and then for her home and its contents. She loses everything, and after referring to happiness as a bubble that soon bursts, she crushes the glass in her hand and is cut so badly that Dr. Van Martyn is called to attend her.In the last chapter Cecile is seen as a demure little convent teacher in gray. One of her pupils runs out of the gate, and in saving the child from being run over Cecile is seriously injured.Those with whom Miss Murray's gyrations and charming personality find favor will enjoy this lavish picture, in spite of its impossible contrasts and happenings. THE SCREEN; Ibanez and Mae Murray."

2636,1924,"The magnificent courage of those sterling Texas cattlemen immediately after the Civil War is portrayed vividly in the picturization of the late Emerson Hough's trenchant story, ""North of 36,"" which is the feature at the Rivoli this week. And again one is stilled with pride and admiration as one harks back to the valorous deeds of rugged, resourceful Americans.There was ""The Covered Wagon,"" which told in inspiring scenes of the men and women who in defiance of danger and deprivation forged their way in primitive vehicles to the far-off Pacific coast. Then came the presentation of William Fox's ""The Iron Horse,"" which told of the same blood and brawn bending its efforts in spanning a continent with steel.This new film deals with the heroic exploit of driving 4,500 head of cattle more than a thousand miles. Two of the players who had important parts in ""The Covered Wagon,"" Lois Wilson and Ernest Torrence, are seen in leading rôles in this picture. Jack Holt impersonates Dan McMasters, the hero, and Noah Beery figures as Sim Rudabaugh, a calculating scoundrel.There are some wonderful stretches in which thousands of head of cattle are seen in a marvelous and thrilling stampede, and later being driven across a river. These sequences impart an excellent conception of the well-nigh impossible task facing the cattlemen.Irvin Willat, who produced the natural color film, ""The Wanderer of the Wasteland,"" was assigned by the producers, Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, to the task of directing ""North of 36."" In most of the stretches he has accomplished his work with marked ability, proving his cleverness in the handling of the players. But although the picture is a good one, it is by no means equal to ""The Covered Wagon."" In all its many interesting scenes there is nothing to compare with the performances of Tully Marshall and Ernest Torrence as the two lovable old scouts. Mr. Torrence, while he fills a rôle somewhat similar to that he had in ""The Covered Wagon,"" does not have the opportunity to impress his appearance upon the spectators as he did in that famous picture.One of the chief failings in this production is the lack of real suspense, which materially weakens the whole story. If the villain wishes to steal a trunk containing the land scrip, he gets hold of it with little or no difficulty. On the other hand, when it is recovered from the hero's wagon, the men who find it on that vehicle carefully refrain from questioning the driver.Although Rudabaugh fires off his pistol and causes a little commotion, he does it with impunity until the last chapter, when he is handed over to the Comanche Indians as the slayer of an Indian girl when she was bathing. In such a story the idea of picturing a girl taking her bath in a chalky stream appears to be superfluous. It is of course done to show Rudabaugh's animal nature.Dan McMasters is an old friend of the heroine's father, but to the viewer of this production he seems to fascinate Taisie Lockart in a very short time and without much reason. Miss Wilson, as Taisie, changes her attire with remarkable rapidity. One minute she is wearing rough, check-cloth knickerbockers and in the next she appears in billowing finery.Rudabaugh's eyes are constantly on the lookout for the trunk filled with land scrip, which he knows will soon be of great value. He and his followers are thwarted in their efforts to obtain the scrip. Mr. Torrence's rôle is that of foreman of Miss Lockhart's ranch. He is grim in repose but has an infectious laugh. He tells one young man to enter Taisie's abode and propose to her, and then proceeds to watch what is going on. When he glues his nose against the window pane he is very funny, and this scene brought forth much laughter from the audience.Jim Nabours (Mr. Torrence) is opposed to driving the great herd of cattle North of 36, but he is overruled by Taisie, who has heard from McMasters that the animals will be worth a fortune owing to the recent railroad facilities.Another humorous touch is where the patrons of a barroom decide to have a cock fight. The audience laughed heartily yesterday when one of the feathered fighters flew out of the ring on to the heads of the eager watchers.Miss Wilson is decidedly attractive in this picture. She is a composed and restrained heroine, even when tackled by Rudabaugh, who again engineers the stealing of the valuable trunk. Mr. Beery is competent in the heavy rôle, and Mr. Holt, is like a young Buffalo Bill, with short hair and whiskers.Although this production is not nearly as good as ""The Covered Wagon,"" it is a film of importance and one which will afford much entertainment to those who see it.

3028,1924,"The story of ""Circe the Enchantress,"" the new film presentation at the Capitol this week, was written specially for Mae Murray by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, author of ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse."" The author gives the irrepressible screen star plenty of opportunity to satisfy her usual desire for long stretches of syncopated action, which are a decided contrast to the later chapters of the narrative.Ibáñez is said to have witnessed more than one of Miss Murray's pictures, and it apparently occurred to him that the most dramatic situation that could happen to such a nimble-footed dancer would be to have her temporarily deprived of the use of her legs through an automobile accident. Hence in the last chapter of this fantastic story one sees the dazzling Cecile Brunne (Miss Murray) limp haltingly into the arms of the hero. Thereafter one perceives Cecile unusually quiet, which, of course, is strange when one thinks of Miss Murray.For the most part of this picture, however, Miss Murray has things her own way, as in this exquisitely staged production Cecile is introduced as a dazzling vision in white, bejeweled from forehead to ankle. In her ecstatic delight she cares little about her shimmering gowns, as in one of the giddy sequences in which she is the only woman in a Long Island mansion she makes fools of the men who are captivated by her beauty by plunging into an artificial lake and insisting that they follow her. These puppets, as she calls them, attired in dress suits, obey the fascinating flirt by splashing awkwardly through the water.Miss Murray gives an exhibition of dancing, while a negro jazz orchestra delights in the blare and quick movements of the graceful dancer. Miss Murray's lips are made up in a futuristic shape and her eyebrows are diagonal. Altogether, she is exotic, graceful, dainty and lithe.James Kirkwood impersonates Dr. Van Martyn, the hero. He is a guest at one of the wild parties, but soon tires of the company and the dizzy amusement, leaving without thanking his hostess. Cecile is patterned after Circe, the goddess who beguiled Ulysses and his warriors. The young Long Island hostess finds that the quiet Dr. Van Martyn has caused her heart to throb, and in her desire to forget him she becomes more reckless than ever. You see her throwing dice, first for $1,000 and then for her home and its contents. She loses everything, and after referring to happiness as a bubble that soon bursts, she crushes the glass in her hand and is cut so badly that Dr. Van Martyn is called to attend her.In the last chapter Cecile is seen as a demure little convent teacher in gray. One of her pupils runs out of the gate, and in saving the child from being run over Cecile is seriously injured.Those with whom Miss Murray's gyrations and charming personality find favor will enjoy this lavish picture, in spite of its impossible contrasts and happenings. THE SCREEN; Ibanez and Mae Murray."

3712,1924,"A boisterous and frivolous fantasy, concerned with a world of women and the sudden discovery of a solitary man is the present film attraction at the Central Theatre. It bears the title of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and is pictured rather in the Mack Sennett vein, ladened with the pulchritude of the Hollywood studio variety.It is in the year 1960, when, through some curious plague, all males over 14 become victims and die. The women do not seem grief-stricken as they go about their respective duties with bright faces and weird costumes. The fashions are given to transparent hoopskirts and pantaloons or the simpler mode of the one-piece bathing suit. The Presidentess of the United States has permitted the White House to become a ruin, with towering weeds and high grass on the hitherto beautiful lawns. She is very fond of black cats, but does become unusually interested in the finding of a male of the species who is 34 years old. Being the first lady of the land, she insists that the last man on earth be sent to the White House. The discoverer, however, has an eye for money and holds that the man is worth at least $10,000,000.The Senatoress from Massachusetts and the Senatoress from California agree that there shall be a prizefight between two women to see who wins the lone man.The boys under 14 are pampered like weak girls, especially after the discovery of a serum which readers them immune from the plague. When Greenwich Gertie, a clever crook and leader of the much-feared Tea House Gang, comes across Elmer (Earl Foxe) hiding in the backwoods she believes that she has done more than the discoverer of the serum. Here you see Elmer being lugged into a hospital and examined by the physicians, while scores of women throng the passages outside. He is deprived of his beard and long hair and made to appear respectable, with trousers that flare and silk insertions in the bell-shaped extremities. He has to go to Washington to see the two political leaders, in bathing suits, fighting to win him. The Presidentess even permits him to sit in her chair. Elmer is the most petted man that has ever stepped on earth, and yet he does not appear to enjoy all the attention he receives.Merchants announce their appointment to dress, manicure and barber The Man and newspapers follow his every move. As an entertainment for the brain-weary this may achieve its purpose. THE SCREEN; A Boisterous Fantasy."

4431,1924,"A boisterous and frivolous fantasy, concerned with a world of women and the sudden discovery of a solitary man is the present film attraction at the Central Theatre. It bears the title of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and is pictured rather in the Mack Sennett vein, ladened with the pulchritude of the Hollywood studio variety.It is in the year 1960, when, through some curious plague, all males over 14 become victims and die. The women do not seem grief-stricken as they go about their respective duties with bright faces and weird costumes. The fashions are given to transparent hoopskirts and pantaloons or the simpler mode of the one-piece bathing suit. The Presidentess of the United States has permitted the White House to become a ruin, with towering weeds and high grass on the hitherto beautiful lawns. She is very fond of black cats, but does become unusually interested in the finding of a male of the species who is 34 years old. Being the first lady of the land, she insists that the last man on earth be sent to the White House. The discoverer, however, has an eye for money and holds that the man is worth at least $10,000,000.The Senatoress from Massachusetts and the Senatoress from California agree that there shall be a prizefight between two women to see who wins the lone man.The boys under 14 are pampered like weak girls, especially after the discovery of a serum which readers them immune from the plague. When Greenwich Gertie, a clever crook and leader of the much-feared Tea House Gang, comes across Elmer (Earl Foxe) hiding in the backwoods she believes that she has done more than the discoverer of the serum. Here you see Elmer being lugged into a hospital and examined by the physicians, while scores of women throng the passages outside. He is deprived of his beard and long hair and made to appear respectable, with trousers that flare and silk insertions in the bell-shaped extremities. He has to go to Washington to see the two political leaders, in bathing suits, fighting to win him. The Presidentess even permits him to sit in her chair. Elmer is the most petted man that has ever stepped on earth, and yet he does not appear to enjoy all the attention he receives.Merchants announce their appointment to dress, manicure and barber The Man and newspapers follow his every move. As an entertainment for the brain-weary this may achieve its purpose. THE SCREEN; A Boisterous Fantasy."

4916,1924,"Throughout ""The Snob,"" the new celluloid offering at the Capitol, Monta Bell, the director, apparently fearful that some of his rather original touches might be missed, has overemphasized them to the extent that, instead of being mildly pleasing, these points become not a little irksome. It is all very well to introduce a plain, little girl given to reciting at every opportunity, but constant repetition of such scenes makes this child as annoying to the spectators as she is supposed to be to the visitors in her home. In a number of other stretches Mr. Bell drums home his ideas, when it would have been well for him to remember that Ernest Lubitsch is content to give only a few feet to a masterly stroke.The theme of the narrative is based on a novel by Helen R. Martin. It has possibilities, but Mr. Bell has not made the most of them. On the screen the story is unfolded in such a way as to make the characters unreal. They seem to be devoid of perspicacity—an unthinking lot of puppets merely carrying out the instructions of the director.John Gilbert, who gave splendid performances in ""His Hour"" and ""He Who Gets Slapped,"" is cast in the rôle of the snob. Eugene Curry, a young sycophant of pleasing appearance who belongs to a country family. He fawns upon those he believes to be socially influential and affluent.Nancy Claxton (Norma Shearer), a young heiress hiding from her own circle of friends because of the disgrace attached to the murder of her father, eventually becomes infatuated with Curry. This seems strange, for although she is ignorant of some of his weaknesses. Curry has certain outstanding disagreeable traits which should have been obvious to this supposedly intelligent young woman.After a long close-up kiss, Curry leaves Nancy and goes to take up a post as a junior professor in a small college, where he meets Herrick Appleton, Nancy's former admirer, who does not know where she is. Curry pompously looks upon Appleton as a striving but unintelligent artist, until he is informed that Appleton belongs to an old Boston family. One would think that even Curry would be a little tactful when he possessed this information. However, he can't resist hurrying to Appleton's studio, where after a few moments he blurts out:""So you are one of the Boston Appletons? Why didn't you tell me?""This snob then becomes interested in Dorothy Renzheimer, whose grandfather is a power in the college. The giddy girl prevails upon the old man to elevate Curry to the post of headmaster. Curry falls in love with Dorothy and is terribly put out at hearing that Nancy is very ill. He is human enough to go and see her, and soon after one learns that Curry has married Nancy. This is disclosed through a letter written to Dorothy in which Curry says that he was tricked into the marriage. He little knows that he has married a wealthy girl.The pert and comparatively recent graduate from the flapper ranks is wroth, as well she might be. Curry is seen in his home, and the director goes to much trouble to show the indifference to social amenities in that household. The plethoric brother-in-law drinks his coffee from the saucer, and the ill-natured sister is continually scolding her timid offspring. One would imagine that such a girl as Nancy would have thought twice about marrying into such a mannerless family.In spite of his surroundings and what one may justly surmise to be a small emolument for his scholastic duties. Curry succeeds in arraying himself according to the latest vogue of Fifth Avenue or Sackville Street. The expected usually happens in this picture, and also that which one prays won't take place.Miss Shearer is restrained and charming, but as Nancy one can't help thinking that she is conscious of all her virtues. Conrad Nagel, as the hero, is more pleasing than usual, as he indulges in a variation of expressions and is not as gloomy as in most of his previous love-sick rôles. As for Mr. Gilbert's performance, he is too lethargic. A little fire would have made Curry more interesting. Phyllis Haver is capable as Dorothy, who powders her face by the hour and worries over flirting and dancing.This adaptation could have been a really fine screen effort had it been handled by Lubitsch. Chaplin or Buchoweight. As it stands, it is a passing entertainment which ought to be cut in many places to avoid repetitions and long-winded close-ups. THE SCREEN; The Sycophant."

5605,1924,"Throughout ""The Snob,"" the new celluloid offering at the Capitol, Monta Bell, the director, apparently fearful that some of his rather original touches might be missed, has overemphasized them to the extent that, instead of being mildly pleasing, these points become not a little irksome. It is all very well to introduce a plain, little girl given to reciting at every opportunity, but constant repetition of such scenes makes this child as annoying to the spectators as she is supposed to be to the visitors in her home. In a number of other stretches Mr. Bell drums home his ideas, when it would have been well for him to remember that Ernest Lubitsch is content to give only a few feet to a masterly stroke.The theme of the narrative is based on a novel by Helen R. Martin. It has possibilities, but Mr. Bell has not made the most of them. On the screen the story is unfolded in such a way as to make the characters unreal. They seem to be devoid of perspicacity—an unthinking lot of puppets merely carrying out the instructions of the director.John Gilbert, who gave splendid performances in ""His Hour"" and ""He Who Gets Slapped,"" is cast in the rôle of the snob. Eugene Curry, a young sycophant of pleasing appearance who belongs to a country family. He fawns upon those he believes to be socially influential and affluent.Nancy Claxton (Norma Shearer), a young heiress hiding from her own circle of friends because of the disgrace attached to the murder of her father, eventually becomes infatuated with Curry. This seems strange, for although she is ignorant of some of his weaknesses. Curry has certain outstanding disagreeable traits which should have been obvious to this supposedly intelligent young woman.After a long close-up kiss, Curry leaves Nancy and goes to take up a post as a junior professor in a small college, where he meets Herrick Appleton, Nancy's former admirer, who does not know where she is. Curry pompously looks upon Appleton as a striving but unintelligent artist, until he is informed that Appleton belongs to an old Boston family. One would think that even Curry would be a little tactful when he possessed this information. However, he can't resist hurrying to Appleton's studio, where after a few moments he blurts out:""So you are one of the Boston Appletons? Why didn't you tell me?""This snob then becomes interested in Dorothy Renzheimer, whose grandfather is a power in the college. The giddy girl prevails upon the old man to elevate Curry to the post of headmaster. Curry falls in love with Dorothy and is terribly put out at hearing that Nancy is very ill. He is human enough to go and see her, and soon after one learns that Curry has married Nancy. This is disclosed through a letter written to Dorothy in which Curry says that he was tricked into the marriage. He little knows that he has married a wealthy girl.The pert and comparatively recent graduate from the flapper ranks is wroth, as well she might be. Curry is seen in his home, and the director goes to much trouble to show the indifference to social amenities in that household. The plethoric brother-in-law drinks his coffee from the saucer, and the ill-natured sister is continually scolding her timid offspring. One would imagine that such a girl as Nancy would have thought twice about marrying into such a mannerless family.In spite of his surroundings and what one may justly surmise to be a small emolument for his scholastic duties. Curry succeeds in arraying himself according to the latest vogue of Fifth Avenue or Sackville Street. The expected usually happens in this picture, and also that which one prays won't take place.Miss Shearer is restrained and charming, but as Nancy one can't help thinking that she is conscious of all her virtues. Conrad Nagel, as the hero, is more pleasing than usual, as he indulges in a variation of expressions and is not as gloomy as in most of his previous love-sick rôles. As for Mr. Gilbert's performance, he is too lethargic. A little fire would have made Curry more interesting. Phyllis Haver is capable as Dorothy, who powders her face by the hour and worries over flirting and dancing.This adaptation could have been a really fine screen effort had it been handled by Lubitsch. Chaplin or Buchoweight. As it stands, it is a passing entertainment which ought to be cut in many places to avoid repetitions and long-winded close-ups. THE SCREEN; The Sycophant."

5637,1924,"Thomas Meighan's latest vehicle, ""Tongues of Flame,"" which was translated to the screen from a story by the late Peter Clark Macfarlane, flows smoothly enough in shadow form—in fact too smoothly, as it lacks drama. This failing is apparent in almost every important situation. It would have been wiser to exclude some of the minor incidents so as to have sufficient footage to devote to the all-necessary dramatic impetus.It is all very well to have a super-hero in such narratives, but this man among men should occasionally show signs of being human. Captain Henry Harrington (Mr. Meighan) never steps down from his pedestal, not even after he has saved the town from destruction by a furious mob. Fire in the vicinity of the jail causes Harrington's release. He had been held there on prohibitive bail at the behest of a conspiring capitalist. Once he is free. Harrington, with the aid of the Indians whom he led in France, subdues the wild rioters and is therefore more of a hero than ever. Instead of challenging the capitalist to put him back in prison. Harrington calmly announces that he must return to jail. This subtitle caused a titter from the audience in the Rivoli yesterday afternoon.In justice to Joseph Henabery, the director, it should be explained that it is difficult to lift such a story out of the usual rut. It should be handled by an enthusiastic scenario writer whose work would guide the director in making the most of the dramatic features. However, Mr. Henabery has accomplished much with the players, which after all is quite a solace when viewing any picture. Bessie Love gives a splendid performance as Lahleet, the half-caste heroine, who never fails Harrington, who had endeavored at the risk of his own life to save her brother in the World War. Miss Love's make-up, the tanned skin and braided blue-black hair, are singularly well suited to her features.Boland, the evil genius who profited by the war to deprive the Indians of their land, schemes to purchase älso the small area left. He knows there is oil on the reservation, but carefully keeps this to himself. Harrington eventually fights to see that the Indians get justice and is waylaid and robbed when he is carrying money to one of the Redskins. The Federal courts eventually decide that the Indians are entitled to the whole town of Edgewater, which infuriates the inhabitants, not against the Indians, but against Boland and his lieutenants. They stone Boland's office and the sight of fire suggests setting fire to scores of other dwellings. This scene is well pictured, as is also the sequence in which Harrington is seen leading the armed Indians. The angry mob declines to cease its incendiarism and Harrington thereupon orders his men to load their rifles and aim. This action causes the mob to bolt in fear.The settings are natural and the direction of the crowds is capable. Eileen Percy figures as Billie Boland, the attractive daughter of the capitalist. Miss Percy is charming in this part and almost makes one sympathize with her father, who after all only wanted to make a good deal. We don't see that it was absolutely necessary for him to broadcast the fact that he knew there was oil on the reservation.Although this production does not prove as exciting as it might, it is never irritating. Mr. Meighan's acting is restrained and sympathetic. However, we would prefer seeing him in a story such as Booth Tarkington or George Ade can write for him. THE SCREEN; A GREEDY PROFITEER."

7232,1924,"Looking as attractive as ever, except possibly for a little too much make-up on her lips, Corinne Griffith is to be seen this week at the Mark Strand in a picture entitled ""Love's Wilderness,"" Helen Klumph's adaptation of a story by Evelyn Campbell. Any film to which Miss Griffith lends her charms has a flying start as a good entertainment, as once one gazes upon her beautiful eyes and eyebrows one is very apt to be lenient with some of the far-fetched situations in the narrative.This particular vehicle, however, is quite interesting even if certain situations are rather strained. Miss Griffith has a number of opportunities to reveal her histrionic talent, and on the whole she acquits herself creditably. Her exhibition of grief in one sequence is perhaps not according to the common conception, and she seems not a little too sophisticated in her portrayal of Linda-Lou Heath, the young Southern girl of 16 who is guarded by two austere and stolid aunts.As the wife of Paul L'Estrange, Linda-Lou is a woman, and therefore Miss Griffith's acting is natural. She is even more convincing as the bride of David Tennant, a young scientist, whom Linda-Lou marries after being informed that Paul has been drowned.There is an undeniable charm about the depiction of life in the Southern town, and Emily Fitzroy, as one of the stern aunts, does her share to add to the interest of these stretches.The chief dramatic incident in this story is where Linda-Lou, while on a visit to Devil's Island (the French convict station), discovers that Paul, her first husband, is not dead, but is one of the prisoners. He with other convicts has broken loose and seeks refuge in Linda-Lou's bungalow. The girl, then married to Tennant, is in a terrible dilemma, as she is filled with pity for Paul. She therefore hides him. Tennant, who had heard of his wife's excursion into the jungle during a furious storm, returns to the dwelling and is overjoyed to find her safe. Suddenly he sees a snake crawling on a ledge and whips out his pistol. Linda-Lou stops Tennant from shooting, fearing that Paul might be slain, with the result that the hidden convict is discovered. Tennant kills the snake, but is inclined to believe that his bride is still in love with her first husband. This portion of the narrative is graphically told in shadow form, with splendid dramatic effect.Tennant (Holmes S. Herbert) hails from Linda-Lou's Southern habitat. He was to have married her, but his work for the French Government had delayed his return and also caused him to neglect writing to her. Paul, the adventurer, comes to the little town and is the first man to tell Linda-Lou that she is beautiful. He is daring and romantic, serenading Linda-Lou with the old song she was wont to play on her harp. So she married Paul, who was an excellent sweetheart, but proved to be an unappreciative husband. He longs to have further adventures, and therefore, so as to get away from his marital bonds, he instructs a friend to tell Linda-Lou that he had perished in crossing the ice.Mr. Herbert is efficient as Tennant, and Ian Keith is capital as Paul. David Torrence is effective as the French Governor of Devil's Island. The settings and scenic effects in this production are admirable, and Robert Leonard has introduced some good touches in the direction.This is an entertainment which is made all the more pleasing by Miss Griffith's radiance.

7572,1924,"At the Capitol this week is an entertaining comedy of married life in marble halls. The theme is one which hitherto usually has been confined to an unpretentious or cottage background, with a few dollars or a wealthy villain as the cause for heated words between the husband and wife. It is quite different in ""So This Is Marriage,"" as the young couple live in a duplex apartment of wide open spaces with stairways that dwarf all humans seen thereon. The main bathroom is so huge that one would almost need a pair of field-glasses to look across it. Then Peter Marsh might never have uttered a scolding word if his wife had not invested $600 in a mah-jong set and then insisted imperiously that she really had been economical.While this production is extravagant, it is exceedingly well directed with splendid comedy touches. Eleanor Boardman, who is such an artist in make-up that she looks perfectly natural on the screen, is efficient and sympathetic as Deth Marsh. She does not strike a false note throughout her performance, and with singular cleverness she reveals why Daniel Rankin suddenly switched from a wolf to a lamb.In the beginning Marsh, told his wife that they would have to ""go slowly"" on expenses when they were married. He is so thrilled at being accepted by the pretty girl that he dreams that night of fabulous wealth. This dream is interestingly pictured, as is also the girl's dream, which is all about clothes.After their marriage the bills are a source of discord, and one day Mrs. Marsh meets Rankin (Lew Cody). He had seen her before and had arranged between Mrs. Marsh's chauffeur and his driver to pretend that her car bad broken down. The conspiracy succeeds, and Rankin drives Mrs. Marsh to her home. She tells her husband and he rages at the idea of her riding with a strange man. There ??? subsequent harmless meetings between Rankin and Beth. In a last talk she has with Rankin he sees her a ""vision of tears"" and sends her home after telling her the story of Bathsheba and King David.This Biblical stretch is in natural colors, having been produced by the Technicolor process. It is of rare beauty, the colors for the most part standing out clearly and impressively. ??? were especially struck by the rubies, turquoises and emeralds in King David's headgear. But the complexion of the women was another matter. We were ??? of an article by G. K. Chesterton, in which he suggested that writers should use the beautiful colors of vegetables rather than flowers in making comparisons. Certainly in Bathsheba's colored countenance ??? seems as if the turnip and the carrot were struggling for supremacy.There are occasions in this sequence when one is facing King David, and Bathsheha is apprearing him from the direction of the audience, that, at one sees her face, it seems as if she must be walking backward. This due to a mistake not infrequently made in pictures, and producers should be in mind that the audience cannot change seats to please the whim of the director or the camera man.Conrad Nagel figures as the husband and he gives an excellent performance, the best acting he has done for a long while. The character suits his personality and he seems to like the part. Mr. Cody is suave as Rankin, but it is nevertheless strange to see this actor, who has figured as as a scoundrel in so many pictures, suddenly seized with pity at the sight of a woman's tears.The audience in the Capitol appeared to enjoy this picture thoroughly and the first chapters were greeted with many an outburst of laughter. It may be an old story, but the setting is so different and the direction so capable that it has renewed interest. THE SCREEN; Marriage in Marble Halls."

8306,1924,"At the Capitol this week is an entertaining comedy of married life in marble halls. The theme is one which hitherto usually has been confined to an unpretentious or cottage background, with a few dollars or a wealthy villain as the cause for heated words between the husband and wife. It is quite different in ""So This Is Marriage,"" as the young couple live in a duplex apartment of wide open spaces with stairways that dwarf all humans seen thereon. The main bathroom is so huge that one would almost need a pair of field-glasses to look across it. Then Peter Marsh might never have uttered a scolding word if his wife had not invested $600 in a mah-jong set and then insisted imperiously that she really had been economical.While this production is extravagant, it is exceedingly well directed with splendid comedy touches. Eleanor Boardman, who is such an artist in make-up that she looks perfectly natural on the screen, is efficient and sympathetic as Deth Marsh. She does not strike a false note throughout her performance, and with singular cleverness she reveals why Daniel Rankin suddenly switched from a wolf to a lamb.In the beginning Marsh, told his wife that they would have to ""go slowly"" on expenses when they were married. He is so thrilled at being accepted by the pretty girl that he dreams that night of fabulous wealth. This dream is interestingly pictured, as is also the girl's dream, which is all about clothes.After their marriage the bills are a source of discord, and one day Mrs. Marsh meets Rankin (Lew Cody). He had seen her before and had arranged between Mrs. Marsh's chauffeur and his driver to pretend that her car bad broken down. The conspiracy succeeds, and Rankin drives Mrs. Marsh to her home. She tells her husband and he rages at the idea of her riding with a strange man. There ??? subsequent harmless meetings between Rankin and Beth. In a last talk she has with Rankin he sees her a ""vision of tears"" and sends her home after telling her the story of Bathsheba and King David.This Biblical stretch is in natural colors, having been produced by the Technicolor process. It is of rare beauty, the colors for the most part standing out clearly and impressively. ??? were especially struck by the rubies, turquoises and emeralds in King David's headgear. But the complexion of the women was another matter. We were ??? of an article by G. K. Chesterton, in which he suggested that writers should use the beautiful colors of vegetables rather than flowers in making comparisons. Certainly in Bathsheba's colored countenance ??? seems as if the turnip and the carrot were struggling for supremacy.There are occasions in this sequence when one is facing King David, and Bathsheha is apprearing him from the direction of the audience, that, at one sees her face, it seems as if she must be walking backward. This due to a mistake not infrequently made in pictures, and producers should be in mind that the audience cannot change seats to please the whim of the director or the camera man.Conrad Nagel figures as the husband and he gives an excellent performance, the best acting he has done for a long while. The character suits his personality and he seems to like the part. Mr. Cody is suave as Rankin, but it is nevertheless strange to see this actor, who has figured as as a scoundrel in so many pictures, suddenly seized with pity at the sight of a woman's tears.The audience in the Capitol appeared to enjoy this picture thoroughly and the first chapters were greeted with many an outburst of laughter. It may be an old story, but the setting is so different and the direction so capable that it has renewed interest. THE SCREEN; Marriage in Marble Halls."

9563,1924,"That wonderful ecstatic laughter, tinkling and beautiful, just the laughter that Barrie loves to hear, greeted Herbert Brenon's picturized version of ""Peter Pan"" yesterday afternoon in the Rivoli. Again and again the silence of the audience was snapped by the ringing laugh of a single boy which was quickly followed by an outburst from dozens of others, some of whom shook in their seats in sheer Joy at what they saw upon the screen. It was laughter that reminded one of the days of long ago when one believed in a sort of Never Never Land, when the smiling sun on an early morning made one dance with joy over the dew-covered grass, when the fragrant Spring flowers sent a thrill through one's youthful soul, when one gazed at a real fish in a shallow rippling stream and expected to hook it with a bent pin, when one thought that after all it might be possible to fly.These jubilant outbursts from youthful throats even brought to mind some beautiful anthem one had heard the choir singing in a lofty cathedral. It was laughter that brought a tear of exuberant gladness to our eyes—laughter that makes grown-ups delighted to be alive.To our right was a mother reading the titles to her tiny son, who was so excited that he only rested against the edge of his seat for fear that the two women in front of him might lean their heads so that he might miss a fragment of the entertainment. He was enraptured, and evidently his mother ceased for a while to explain the captions, as she, too, was engrossed in the story. There were numerous Mr. and Mrs. Darlings in the theatre and often the alto laughter of the young was almost drowned by the merriment of rugged baritones mingled with the bell-toned sopranos. Anybody who had a boy or a girl, or both, was doubly entertained by this charming fantasy, especially when Peter Pan teaches Wendy, Michael and John Darling to fly. The joy of the boys and girls was boundless when John and Michael failed to soar through the air and plunged on their beds. Later the little ones were filled with awe when Michael, after concentrating with a frown on good thoughts, suddenly flew clean across the room and alighted on the mantelpiece.The young onlookers were ??? with amazement when Peter and the Darling children flew around and around the bedroom, and then out of the window on their way to the Never Never Land.To many of the boys and girls. Nana was a real dog, awkward but sympathetic and rather clever. They enjoyed seeing Nana give Michael his medicine and they were aghast when Mr. Darling in the most cowardly way poured his nasty medicine into the faithful Nana's bowl. And great was the chagrin in many youthful souls when Nana was taken outside in the cold.Obviously inspired by his discussions with Sir James Barrie, Mr. Brenon has fashioned a brilliant and entrancing production of this fantasy, one which is a great credit to the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation and also to the whole motion picture industry. It is not a movie, but a pictorial masterpiece which we venture to say will meet the approval of the author. While he has introduced some ideas which were not possible on the stage???, Mr. Brenon has not strayed from the theme of the whimsical story. In the Never Never Land mermaids are seen by the sun-lit sea and when the redoubtable Captain Hook has captured the children, these mermaids swim forth to find the crocodile that causes the pirate to quake with terror. The scene of the mermaids is effective and beautiful.Betty Bronson is a graceful, vivacious and alert Peter Pan. She is youth and joy, and one appreciates that she revels in the rôle. Her large eyes are wide with wonder when she first greets Wendy and she is lithe, erect and straight of limb when she fearlessly fights the horrible Captain Hook on his pirate craft. In most of the scenes her hair seems to have a natural boyish curl, but in one close-up, which might be eliminated, one was strongly reminded of a marcel wave. She is a Peter Pan to delight the children and entertain the adults.Captain Hook is impersonated by Ernest Torrence, who is as effective as he can be as a gruff pirate whose voice is not heard. However???, to make up for the loss of Hook's deep, challenging tones, the pirate has a real ship floating on glistening waters. The fight between the children and the pirates, a source of delight to the small boys, takes place aboard the ship that flies the skull and crossbones. In the film Captain Hook throws the alarm clock to the crocodile, so that he will ever be warned of its approach by the tick-tocking. The brave Peter of the picture relieves the crocodile of the clock so that it can steal upon the unsuspecting Hook and ""get the rest of him.""One sees Tinker Bell as a light and also as a tiny, tiny fairy, which is cleverly pictured through double exposure. Cyril Chadwick plays the part of Mr. Darling and, excent that he is too quick in his movements in his moments of irritation, he is quite good.There are some lines we would like to have seen in the captions, but most of the important phrases have been used. In some of the text the title writer has employed some combinations of words that are hardly Barriesque.Esther Ralston is comely as Mrs. Darling, whose mouth is ""full of thimbles."" Mary Brian makes a charming Wendy, and Philippe de Lacey and Jack Murphy are effective in their respective r???òles of Michael and John.George Ali figures under the covering of Nana, and he makes the ""dog"" give an admirable performance. The appealing look that comes to Nana's eyes, the ""nurse's"" devotion and bewilderment are quite fascinating.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld has prefaced this production with a colorful prologue. The same picture is also on view at the Rialto. THE SCREEN; A Delightful Picture."

9969,1924,"The most stirring chapters in Richard Barthelmess's latest vehicle, ""Classmates,"" are those that were photographed at West Point. They are sincere and informing, revealing the disciplinary mill through which the young men from all walks of life pass before they become officers of the United States Army. One gains a vivid impression of the glories and traditions of the military institution. The fact that John Robertson, the director of this film, received the hearty cooperation of the West Point officers materially adds to the interest of these sequences, without which this photoplay would be rather tame.The life of the budding officers is cleverly traced from the day they enter the academy to the time when they graduate. One is quite affected by the sight of Duncan Irving (Mr. Barthelmess) leaving the precincts of the institution after dismissal. He hesitates as the colors are hauled down and the band as usual plays ""The Star Spangled Banner."" Yesterday when the national anthem was rendered in the Mark Strand everybody in the packed house stood up, filled with the spirit of patriotism and gripped with sympathy for Irving.It is also inspiring to watch the scenes in the old Southern town, where Irving receives the letter notifying him of his appointment to West Point. One can imagine his joy as he almost stands on his head after looking in a dazed way at the West Point flag on the wall of his small room.The audience was intensely amused when Irving makes his first appearance at West Point. He is told to do so many things by the first class cadets that he can hardly follow them in their desires. Out comes his chest, down comes his head, and his feet click together. Later, when he is himself one of the important first class cadets, he discovers Bert Stafford (Reginald Sheffield) as a plebe. Stafford is opposed to discipline, as he considers himself Irving's social superior. Irving examines Stafford's lockers and finds that the towels have not been stacked according to orders. He throws them on the floor, which angers Stafford. Then he notices Sylvia Randolph's photograph in the plebe's room and is depressed as he believes the girl is engaged to Stafford.There is a humorous sequence dealing with mild hazing, when the plebes have to perform for the edification of the first class cadets. The younger men are depicted crouching like frogs, ready to do the bidding of their omnipotent superiors. This causes Stafford to rebel, and only when he insults Irving's father does the latter fling aside discipline and strike Stafford. One blow and Stafford says that he can't see. He has been blinded, and for this reason Irving is dismissed from the academy. This is rather weak, especially in these days, as later one is given to suppose that Stafford had been shamming most of the time.There is a long and rather tedious set of scenes dealing with action in the South American jungle, where Irving and his friends, ""Silent"" Clay and Bobby Durable, have traveled to rescue Stafford. Coincidence is piled on coincidence in this stretch, and the idea of hellographing by means of a tin pan stuck in the trees is a strain on one's good nature.Mr. Barthelmess is quite a serious stoic in his acting. He ought to relax more in his expressions and forget the camera. He exudes heroism, and appears to be afraid in some of the scenes to look as he does when away from the studio. He spoils his good looks by his frequent frown and heroic consciousness. Actually the best performance in this production is that of James Bradbury Jr. as ""Silent"" Clay. He is so natural—quite the antithesis to Mr. Barthelmess—that one almost forgets that he is acting. Madge Evans is sympathetic and effective as Sylvia. Another good bit of characterization is that of Beach Cooke as Dumble.""Classmates"" was first produced as a film nine years ago, with Henry B. Walthall as Irving, Blanche Sweet as Sylvia, and Marshall Neilan as Stafford. We saw both these productions on the same night. The fashions in the old picture elicited much laughter. Mr. Robertson has brought an old story up to date, but the narrative as seen in the new production is frayed with age. THE SCREEN; A West Point Story."

10257,1924,"That wonderful ecstatic laughter, tinkling and beautiful, just the laughter that Barrie loves to hear, greeted Herbert Brenon's picturized version of ""Peter Pan"" yesterday afternoon in the Rivoli. Again and again the silence of the audience was snapped by the ringing laugh of a single boy which was quickly followed by an outburst from dozens of others, some of whom shook in their seats in sheer Joy at what they saw upon the screen. It was laughter that reminded one of the days of long ago when one believed in a sort of Never Never Land, when the smiling sun on an early morning made one dance with joy over the dew-covered grass, when the fragrant Spring flowers sent a thrill through one's youthful soul, when one gazed at a real fish in a shallow rippling stream and expected to hook it with a bent pin, when one thought that after all it might be possible to fly.These jubilant outbursts from youthful throats even brought to mind some beautiful anthem one had heard the choir singing in a lofty cathedral. It was laughter that brought a tear of exuberant gladness to our eyes—laughter that makes grown-ups delighted to be alive.To our right was a mother reading the titles to her tiny son, who was so excited that he only rested against the edge of his seat for fear that the two women in front of him might lean their heads so that he might miss a fragment of the entertainment. He was enraptured, and evidently his mother ceased for a while to explain the captions, as she, too, was engrossed in the story. There were numerous Mr. and Mrs. Darlings in the theatre and often the alto laughter of the young was almost drowned by the merriment of rugged baritones mingled with the bell-toned sopranos. Anybody who had a boy or a girl, or both, was doubly entertained by this charming fantasy, especially when Peter Pan teaches Wendy, Michael and John Darling to fly. The joy of the boys and girls was boundless when John and Michael failed to soar through the air and plunged on their beds. Later the little ones were filled with awe when Michael, after concentrating with a frown on good thoughts, suddenly flew clean across the room and alighted on the mantelpiece.The young onlookers were ??? with amazement when Peter and the Darling children flew around and around the bedroom, and then out of the window on their way to the Never Never Land.To many of the boys and girls. Nana was a real dog, awkward but sympathetic and rather clever. They enjoyed seeing Nana give Michael his medicine and they were aghast when Mr. Darling in the most cowardly way poured his nasty medicine into the faithful Nana's bowl. And great was the chagrin in many youthful souls when Nana was taken outside in the cold.Obviously inspired by his discussions with Sir James Barrie, Mr. Brenon has fashioned a brilliant and entrancing production of this fantasy, one which is a great credit to the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation and also to the whole motion picture industry. It is not a movie, but a pictorial masterpiece which we venture to say will meet the approval of the author. While he has introduced some ideas which were not possible on the stage???, Mr. Brenon has not strayed from the theme of the whimsical story. In the Never Never Land mermaids are seen by the sun-lit sea and when the redoubtable Captain Hook has captured the children, these mermaids swim forth to find the crocodile that causes the pirate to quake with terror. The scene of the mermaids is effective and beautiful.Betty Bronson is a graceful, vivacious and alert Peter Pan. She is youth and joy, and one appreciates that she revels in the rôle. Her large eyes are wide with wonder when she first greets Wendy and she is lithe, erect and straight of limb when she fearlessly fights the horrible Captain Hook on his pirate craft. In most of the scenes her hair seems to have a natural boyish curl, but in one close-up, which might be eliminated, one was strongly reminded of a marcel wave. She is a Peter Pan to delight the children and entertain the adults.Captain Hook is impersonated by Ernest Torrence, who is as effective as he can be as a gruff pirate whose voice is not heard. However???, to make up for the loss of Hook's deep, challenging tones, the pirate has a real ship floating on glistening waters. The fight between the children and the pirates, a source of delight to the small boys, takes place aboard the ship that flies the skull and crossbones. In the film Captain Hook throws the alarm clock to the crocodile, so that he will ever be warned of its approach by the tick-tocking. The brave Peter of the picture relieves the crocodile of the clock so that it can steal upon the unsuspecting Hook and ""get the rest of him.""One sees Tinker Bell as a light and also as a tiny, tiny fairy, which is cleverly pictured through double exposure. Cyril Chadwick plays the part of Mr. Darling and, excent that he is too quick in his movements in his moments of irritation, he is quite good.There are some lines we would like to have seen in the captions, but most of the important phrases have been used. In some of the text the title writer has employed some combinations of words that are hardly Barriesque.Esther Ralston is comely as Mrs. Darling, whose mouth is ""full of thimbles."" Mary Brian makes a charming Wendy, and Philippe de Lacey and Jack Murphy are effective in their respective r???òles of Michael and John.George Ali figures under the covering of Nana, and he makes the ""dog"" give an admirable performance. The appealing look that comes to Nana's eyes, the ""nurse's"" devotion and bewilderment are quite fascinating.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld has prefaced this production with a colorful prologue. The same picture is also on view at the Rialto. THE SCREEN; A Delightful Picture."
